Overview
========

Welcome to the User Guide for Linopy. This guide is designed to help you understand and effectively use Linopy's features to solve your optimization problems, complementing the ``Getting Started`` section.

In the following sections, we will take a closer look at how to create and manipulate models, variables, and constraints, and how to solve these models to find optimal solutions. Each section includes detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand the concepts and apply them to your own projects.

If you are completely new to Linopy, consider to first have a look at the `Getting Started` section.

Let's get started!
